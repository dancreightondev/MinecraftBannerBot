# BannerBot 1430
***BannerBot 1430 is a Python bot that generates a random Minecraft banner design.***

Based on the Python Imaging Library (more commonly known as PIL), this Python program will generate an image that looks like the design of a banner that could be created in the video game [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/).
